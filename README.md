# DS_Linked_List
A linked list in simple terms is a linear collection of data elements.
These data elements are called nodes. 
Linked list is a data structure which in turn can be used to implement other data structures.
A linked list is a collection of nodes in which linear representation is given links from one node to the next node.
Every node contains two parts, an integer and a pointer to the next node.
The left part of the node contains data that may include a simple data type, an array or a structure.
The right part of the node contains a pointer to the next node (or address of the next node in sequence).
The last node will have no next node connected to it, so it will store a special value called NULL.
Linked list contains a pointer variable START that stores the address of the first node in the list. If START=NULL, then the linked list is empty and contains no nodes.
